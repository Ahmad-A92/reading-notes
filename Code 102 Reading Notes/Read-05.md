- **Comparison operators- pages(150&151):** It is the operators that compare values and return true or false. The operators include: >(greater than), <(less than), >= (greater than or equal), <= (less than or equal to), === (strict equal to ),== (is equal to),!= (is not equal to), and !== (strict not equal to ).
- **Logical Operator pages(156&157):** It is a symbol or word used to connect two or more expressions such that the value of the compound expression produced depends only on that of the original expressions and on the meaning of the operator. Common logical operators include AND(&&), OR(\|\|), and NOT(!).logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When it is, it returns a Boolean value.Starting with AND (&&), The logical  ( && ) operator (logical conjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if all of its operands are true. moving to The logical OR (\|\|) operator (logical disjunction) for a set of operands is true if and only if one or more of its operands is true. Finally, The logical NOT (!) operator (logical complement, negation) takes truth to falsity and vice versa.

## Loops(pages 170-173): 
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.a loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things.Loops are supported by javascript, though their implementations and syntax may differ. three of the most common types of loops are: the while loop, do while loop, and the for loop.
### Using for statement: 
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
A for statement looks as follows:

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

### using While loop (page 176)
A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows: 
while (condition)
  statement

If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
