# **Intro + Scripts: Pages 1 - 24** 
## INTRODUCTION: 
Over this part the writer mention for the reader how to use the book, the main content of the book, what each chapter at the book includes, and revision for HTML and CSS languages. After that, he moved to give the reader brieve introduction about this language for the biggener. Following points higlight main aspects in this part of the book. 
### The major features that the javascript add to the web page is that it makes the webpage more interactive including:  
- ACCESS CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
- MODIFY CONTENT: You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them
- PROGRAM RULES: You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page
- REACT TO EVENTS: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.
## **script:**
 it is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following: RECIPES, HANDBOOKS, or MANUALS. 
- **How to Write A script:** To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.then, you have to design a script by splitting the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle, which cane be represented using a flowchart. Finally, you can start coding each step written in a programming language that the computer 
understands such as javascript. 

# **Expressions + Operators: 74 - 79**
An expression: evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:
- Expressions that just assign a value to a variable.
- expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.
Operators: Operators are symbolic characters that specify the action to be performed on their associated operands. Each operand consists of one or more expressions or expression atoms. There are vatious type of the operators as follows: 
- Assignment operators : Assign a value to a variable.
- Arithmetic operators: Perform basic math; JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers: addition + adds one value to another, - subtraction subtracts one value from another, division i divides two values, multiplication * multiplies two values using an asterisk, and modulus % Divides two values and returns the remainder
- String operators: There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
- Comparison operators: Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se
- Logical operators: Combine expressions and return true or fa 1 se

# **Functions: 88 - 94**
***Function:*** It is  similar to a procedure set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To create the function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its tasks inside the curly braces. This know as **function decleration**. Having decleared the function, you can then execuate all  of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This known as **calling of the function**. When calling the function that has aparameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or as variables.
