Text-Editor: A text editor is a piece of software that you download and installs on your computer, or your access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. There are various text-editor that use by the developer and each one has it is advantages plus unique features. following is mention for some of the most popular editors:   NotePad++, TextWrangler/BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text. 

command-line/terminal: is a text-based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly to text.

How to open a terminal in Windows:  you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty. (Links to an external site.)

Shell: it is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. 

major commands: Here we going to mention the major command that we need regularly when using the terminal: 

pwd : stands for Print Working Directory, and its uses to print the current path. 
ls: stands for a List the contents of a directory, and its uses to print the name of the files and folders that exist in the exciting trajectory. 
ls-a: same the above command, but it shows List the contents of a directory, including hidden files. Take into consideration that the ls command merely shows the unhidden file and directory. 
cd: stand for change directory. Its uses to move to another directory exist in the parent directory. 
file: to determine the type of file
highlighted points:

we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time.
In Windows the extension is important and the system uses it to determine what type of file it is., while in Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is.
Linux is are case sensitive so we have to be aware of case sensitivity when dealing with command-line options and directory path. 
In Linux, the spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to by the name that includes space between quotes or the other method is to use an escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). Otherwise, Linux will read only the first word and consider it as the directory name. 
Linux actually has a very simple and elegant mechanism for specifying that a file or directory is hidden. If the file or directory's name begins with a. (full stop) then it is considered to be hidden. Accordingly, you can create a hidden file or directory by stating its name with a dot (.).
