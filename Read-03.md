# **This is a summarisation for some chapters selected from HTML&CSS- design and build websites, written by Jon Duckett:**
## **chapter 18:Process & Design**
This chapter aims at providing the web-developer of the process required for creating new web site: 
-  **First Step:** *Determine the the web site audiance that the site target*; At the level of the individual we may intrest in : users age range, the users' countries, level of education for the users,  users' income, users' occupation,and no of the working hours. For companies, the major points that we may intrest to know when creat the web site is: the size of company, position of people in the company who visit your site, amount of budget that the company control. 
- **Second Step:** *Determine the reason that the people may visit the created website*; like looking for time
sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular topic.
- **Third Step:** Determine What visitors are trying to achieve; what means is the key tasks and motivations.
- **Forth Step:** *Determine Information web site that visitors need*; By this you may want to offer additional
supporting information that you think they might find helpful.
- **Fifth Step:** *Determine the method that the users will visit your site;* Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static. 
- **Sixth Step:** *create of the site map;* Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

After that you can start to make sketch for your web page, which called wireframe.
 ### **wireframe:**
 wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require. By creating a wireframe you can
ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.It should focus on what
information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.
### **Visual hierarchy**
refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
### **grouping and Similarity:** 
When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. There are many ways this can be achieved including: Proximity, Closure, Continuance, White Space, color, Borders. 
## **chapter 17:HTML5 Layout** 
The following point is a summarization for HTML elements mentioned at this chapter: 
- **div elements:** it is used o group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar).Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the div element in the structure of the page. 
- **header & footer  elements:** They can be used for: The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site. Also, for A header or footer for an individual article or section within the page.
- **nav element:** The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
- **article element:**It is acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.
- **aside element:** The `<aside>` element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not. When the <aside> element is used inside an article
element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to. When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.
- **section element:** it groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
- **figure element:** It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article  such as images.
- **div element:** It is an important way to group together related elements. 
## **chapter 8:Extra Markup** 
 - **!DOCTYPE html:** Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.
 - **< !-- -- > element**: if developer want to add a comment to the HTML code that will not be visible in the user's browser, he can add the text between these characters. 
 - **ID Attribute:** Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).
 - **Class Attribute:** Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a 
way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.
 - **iframe element:** An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame. There are a few attributes that used within this element: *scr*is for specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame, *height* is for determine the height of the frame in pixels, *width* is to specifies the width attribute the iframe in pixels.
 - **meta element:** This element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.It uses attributes to carry the information. The most common attributes are the name and content attributes, which tend to be used together.
