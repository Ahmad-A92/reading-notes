# **This is a summarisation for some chapters selected from HTML&CSS- design and build websites, written by Jon Duckett:**
## **chapter 18:Process & Design**
This chapter aims at providing the web-developer of the process required for creating new web site: 
-  **First Step:** *Determine the the web site audiance that the site target*; At the level of the individual we may intrest in : users age range, the users' countries, level of education for the users,  users' income, users' occupation,and no of the working hours. For companies, the major points that we may intrest to know when creat the web site is: the size of company, position of people in the company who visit your site, amount of budget that the company control. 
- **Second Step:** *Determine the reason that the people may visit the created website*; like looking for time
sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular topic.
- **Third Step:** Determine What visitors are trying to achieve; what means is the key tasks and motivations.
- **Forth Step:** *Determine Information web site that visitors need*; By this you may want to offer additional
supporting information that you think they might find helpful.
- **Fifth Step:** *Determine the method that the users will visit your site;* Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static. 
- **Sixth Step:** *create of the site map;* Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.\n

After that you can start to make sketch for your web page, which called wireframe.\n
 ### **wireframe:**
 wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require. By creating a wireframe you can
ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.It should focus on what
information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.\n
### **Visual hierarchy**
refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
### **grouping and Similarity:** 
When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. There are many ways this can be achieved including: Proximity, Closure, Continuance, White Space, color, Borders. 
## **chapter 17:HTML5 Layout** 
- **<div> elements:** it is used o group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar).Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
